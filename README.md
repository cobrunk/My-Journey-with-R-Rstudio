A working documentation of the skills and tools I am gaining with R &amp; Rstudio. Most work has been done through a Master's program.

## Contents

### Module 2 Hws.R
* Created two numerical vectors of different lengths and then added them.
* Downloaded specified data for three keywords from Google Trends into RStudio.
* Found and analyzied the months in wich the keywords with most popular and least popular.
* Located the total number of search results for each keyword.
* Solved for the total number of months between January 2014 and December 2019 when one keyword was more popular than another.

### Module 3 Hws.R
* Loaded data into a dataframe.
* Created two matrices with specified values.
* Found element-wise and matrix multiplication of the matrices.
* Loaded an image utilizing the imager package.
* Found the dimensions of the image and plotted it.
* Collected Google Trends data abd Yahoo finance data for one company
* Plotted each dataset and analyzied any correlation/relationship

### Module 4 Hws.R
* Created a function that evaluates the relationship between two variables to output conditional responses.
* Using a For loop, incremented each value of a column by 1 from a given dataset.
* Incremented the values of a column by 1 based on a conditional statement.
* Exported the changes to a csv file.
* Created a black frame around a given picture.

### Module 5 Hws.R
* Downloaded and incorporated Google Trends data for two key words for graphing and analysis.
* Created a boxplot and a line plot compairing both keywords.
* Created a histogram and density plot for each keyword.
* Filtered data from a given data set.
* Grouped the filtered data based on state and found the sum of case numbers and case deaths.
* Made a boxplot showiung a comparison of cases and deaths for the states.
* Created a line plot for case numbers and deaths over tiume for each state.
* Created two histograms for each state showing case numbers and deaths.
* Created two density plots for each state showing case numbers and deaths.

### Module 6 Hws.R
* Created a Shiny App the contains a checkbox input to toggle a histogram
* Created a histogram from a given dataset.
* Created a Shiny App with a date-range input to select a start and end date.
* Utilized Google Trends data for two keywords to create a plot point for the shiny app.
* Diffentiated the keywords on the plot point by color.

### Module 7 Hws.R
* Loaded a JSON file into RStudio.
* Updated the information in the file.
* Displayed updated info.
* Connected to a mySQL database.
* Created a new database within the SQL db.
* Uploaded a dataset to the db.
* Filtered rows for specified information.
* Created a data-frame from specified columns.

### Module 8 Homeworks.R
* Using a given dataset, created a point plot to showcase linear regression based on various independent and dependent variables.
* Using a given dataset, created a boxplot plot to showcase linear regression based on various independent and dependent variables.
